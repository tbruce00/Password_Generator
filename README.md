# Password_Generator

For this project we were tasked with creating a password generator that outputs a random password based off user input.

This application uses the javascript skills we learned in Week 3 of the program. 

I have deployed this project to my Githun page and have included the applications link.

## Overview of Generator

This password generator uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to present the user with a sleek and easy-to-use application that allows them to select from a series of prompts to create a password between 8 and 128 characters. 

## Features

This application presents the user with an event listener "click" button that sets of a series of prompts, including in order:

    - A choice of characters from 8 to 128
    - A choice for numbers
    - A choice for Uppercase letters
    - A choice for Lowercase letters
    - A choice for special characters


Based of their confirmations of the above criteria, the page will utilize Javascript with a series of variables and statements that prints out in the password box a password that confirms the user's selections.
